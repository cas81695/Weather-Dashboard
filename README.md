# Weather-Dashboard

This Application allows the user to learn of the weather via locally or search

The main container will display the current city with the temperature, humidity, and uv index

A five day forecast will be shown of the current city displayed which shows the temperature and humidity

A local storage will contian previous inputs by the user and dsiplay them in a list under the search input

This application was a challenge as pulling info from an api, to specific criterias was a struggle. Also, the functions of pulling the info and setting it to be displayed in a certain format on js was difficult, but satisfying to learn. This application helped me better under the use of server side api's and how they can be useful in informative apps.
